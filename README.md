## What is Vasudha?

Vasudha is a **three-sided marketplace** that turns the act of rescuing surplus food into a financially auditable carbon reduction event — and sells that proof to enterprises as verified carbon credits.

> **For restaurants:** Post surplus food in 60 seconds. Get paid in carbon credits when it reaches someone who needs it.
>
> **For enterprises:** Buy blockchain-anchored carbon offsets backed by food rescue data you can independently verify on Polygonscan — not promises from a rainforest you've never seen.
>
> **For NGOs:** Receive real-time dispatch, optimised routing, and a sustainable income stream from the platform.

## The Market Problem

| Signal | Data |
|---|---|
| Food wasted in India annually | **68 million tonnes** |
| Indians facing food insecurity | **200 million** |
| CO₂ emitted per kg food in landfill | **2.5 kg CO₂e** |
| Global voluntary carbon credit market (2024) | **$12.7 billion** |
| Carbon credits found to be unverifiable by auditors | **94% of leading rainforest offsets** (Guardian, 2023) |
| Enterprises penalised under India's ESG disclosure mandate | Growing post-BRSR Core (FY24) |

The carbon credit market has a credibility crisis. Buyers have no way to independently verify that the reduction they purchased actually happened. Vasudha solves this with a data trail that starts at a restaurant kitchen and ends on a public blockchain.

## How the Platform Works

```
  1. RESTAURANT POSTS FOOD
     "40kg biryani, expires in 2 hours, pickup: MI Road, Jaipur"
     │
     ▼
  2. AI DISPATCH  (< 3 seconds)
     Haversine distance sort across active NGOs
     OSRM free routing API calculates optimal path
     NGO volunteer receives assignment on their phone
     │
     ▼
  3. RESCUE LIFECYCLE  (Volunteer taps through on mobile)
     Dispatched → Collected from restaurant → Delivered to hunger zone
     GPS + timestamp anchored at every step
     │
     ▼
  4. IMPACT CALCULATION  (on delivery confirmation)
     40 kg rescued
     × 4 meals/kg  = 160 meals served
     × 2.5 kg CO₂  = 100 kg CO₂e prevented = 0.1 tonnes
     │
     ▼
  5. VGC MINTED ON POLYGON  (backend only — never from client)
     0.1 VGC total
     ├── 0.05 VGC → Restaurant wallet  (50%)
     └── 0.05 VGC → Vasudha treasury  (50%)
     │
     ▼
  6. IMMUTABLE MRV RECORD
     Certificate issued with Polygon tx hash
     Publicly auditable — anyone can verify on Polygonscan
     │
     ▼
  7. ENTERPRISE MARKETPLACE
     ESG buyer browses verified VGC listings
     Purchases via MetaMask (MATIC) or B2B invoice (INR)
     Credits retired on-chain → PDF ESG certificate generated
```

## VGC Token — Vasudha Green Credit

**VGC** is an ERC-20 token on Polygon. Each token represents exactly **1 tonne of CO₂-equivalent** prevented through documented food rescue. VGC is never pre-minted, never speculative, and never issued without a corresponding MRV data record.

### Minting Formula

```
1 kg food rescued  =  2.5 kg CO₂e prevented
1,000 kg CO₂e     =  1 tonne CO₂e
1 tonne CO₂e      =  1 VGC minted
```

### Token Distribution (per rescue)

```
              VGC Minted
                  │
        ┌─────────┴─────────┐
        │                   │
      50%                 50%
        │                   │
  Donor Wallet       Vasudha Treasury
  (Restaurant)       (Marketplace pool
                      + operations)
```

### Floor Price

The VGC floor price is **₹800 per token** (1 tonne CO₂e), enforced by the Marketplace smart contract. India's CCTS Voluntary Offset Mechanism (Bureau of Energy Efficiency, 2025) prices verified food waste credits at ₹600–900 per tonne — Vasudha's floor is at parity from launch.

### Token Lifecycle

```

## User Onboarding

### 1. Restaurants & Donors

<img src="./assets/onboarding/donor-onboarding1.png" alt="Donor onboarding flow" width="100%" />
<img src="./assets/onboarding/donor-onboarding2.png" alt="Donor onboarding flow" width="100%" />

**Step 1 — Register at `/donate`**

No email, no password. Registration takes under 60 seconds.

```
Required fields:
  • Business name
  • Type: Restaurant / Caterer / Wedding Hall / Hotel / Household
  • Address  (OpenStreetMap autocomplete)
  • Phone number
  • Typical surplus capacity (kg)
```

**Step 2 — Receive your Donor ID**

Vasudha creates your profile and returns a UUID Donor ID. This is stored in your browser's `localStorage` and sent as `X-Donor-Id` on all future requests. No session management required.

**Step 3 — Connect wallet (optional)**

Click **"Connect MetaMask"** on your dashboard to link a Polygon wallet address. VGC tokens will appear directly in MetaMask. If you skip this step, your VGC balance is tracked internally — connect at any time and your accumulated balance carries over.

> **No wallet?** See [Wallet Setup Guide](#wallet-setup--metamask-guide) or use the [UPI withdrawal path](#selling-vgc--donor-flow) — no crypto knowledge needed.

**Step 4 — Post surplus food**

```
Required fields:
  • Food description       e.g. "Dal, Rice, Sabzi — freshly cooked"
  • Quantity in kg         (live counter shows "This feeds ~N people")
  • Expiry window          1h / 2h / 4h / 8h
  • Pickup address         (pre-filled from profile)
```

Submit → an NGO is auto-matched and dispatched within 10 seconds.

**Donor Dashboard (`/donor/:id`)**

<img src="./assets/screenshots/donor-dashboard.png" alt="Donor Dashboard" width="100%" />

```
  Lifetime Stats
  ├── Total meals served
  ├── Total CO₂ prevented (kg)
  ├── VGC balance (tokens + INR equivalent at floor price)
  └── Total rescue count

  Rescue History  (paginated, newest first)
  └── Each row: food type · quantity · NGO · date · VGC earned · [Certificate]
```

---

### 2. NGO Volunteers

<img src="./assets/screenshots/ngo-dispatch.png" alt="NGO onboarding flow" width="100%" />

**Step 1 — NGO coordinator registers at `/ngo`**

```
Required fields:
  • Organisation name
  • Address and city
  • Contact phone
  • Operational capacity (kg)
```

Registration is submitted for admin review. Once approved, the NGO is active on the platform.

**Step 2 — Coordinator shares NGO ID with volunteers**

Volunteers open `/ngo` on any mobile browser and enter the NGO ID. No app download, no signup — the dispatch interface is a fully responsive PWA.

**Step 3 — Assignments appear automatically**

Active food listings in the NGO's city appear in the dispatch view. New assignments push in without a page refresh (5-second polling).

See [NGO Volunteer Delivery Flow](#ngo-volunteer-delivery-flow) for the complete step-by-step.

---

### 3. Enterprise ESG Buyers

<img src="./assets/onboarding/buyer-onboarding.png" alt="Enterprise buyer onboarding flow" width="100%" />

**Step 1 — Browse marketplace at `/marketplace`**

No registration required. All active VGC listings are publicly visible with blockchain proof links.

**Step 2 — Use the carbon offset calculator**

```
  Input:  Annual CO₂ emissions in tonnes
  Output: VGC tokens needed
          Estimated cost at current market price
          Links to suitable listings
```

**Step 3 — Connect MetaMask and purchase**

Click **"Buy with MetaMask"** on any listing, confirm the MATIC transaction. VGC transfers to your wallet immediately.

**Step 4 — Download ESG certificate**

A PDF certificate is generated containing:

- Buyer entity name
- CO₂ offset quantity (tonnes)
- VGC token IDs
- Blockchain transaction hash
- Vasudha MRV verification statement
- QR code linking to on-chain proof

Accepted for voluntary ESG disclosure under India's BRSR Core framework and CSR compliance under Companies Act Section 135.

---

### 4. Platform Admin

**Access:** Navigate to `/admin` and authenticate with the `ADMIN_SECRET` environment variable. All admin API routes require the `X-Admin-Secret` request header.

```
  Rescue Management    View all rescues filtered by status, city, date range
  NGO Management       Approve / deactivate NGOs, view performance

## Wallet Setup — MetaMask Guide

Vasudha uses **Polygon** for all on-chain activity. MetaMask is the recommended wallet for both donors and enterprise buyers.

### First-Time Setup

**Step 1 — Install MetaMask**
- Desktop: [metamask.io](https://metamask.io) → Chrome / Firefox / Brave extension
- Mobile: MetaMask app from App Store or Google Play

**Step 2 — Create your wallet**
- Click "Create a new wallet" and set a password
- **Write your 12-word Secret Recovery Phrase on paper. Store it offline. Never share it.**

**Step 3 — Add Polygon Mainnet**

In MetaMask → Settings → Networks → Add Network:

```
Network Name:    Polygon Mainnet
RPC URL:         https://polygon-rpc.com
Chain ID:        137
Currency Symbol: MATIC
Block Explorer:  https://polygonscan.com
```

For testnet development:

```
Network Name:    Polygon Amoy Testnet
RPC URL:         https://rpc-amoy.polygon.technology
Chain ID:        80002
Currency Symbol: MATIC
Block Explorer:  https://amoy.polygonscan.com
```

**Step 4 — Fund your wallet with MATIC**
- Mainnet: Purchase MATIC on any Indian exchange (CoinDCX, WazirX) and withdraw to your address
- Testnet: Use [faucet.polygon.technology](https://faucet.polygon.technology) for free test MATIC

**Step 5 — Import VGC token**

MetaMask → Import Token → paste the VGC contract address from your `.env`. The token will appear as "VGC".

**Step 6 — Connect to Vasudha**

Click **"Connect Wallet"** on any Vasudha page. MetaMask prompts for connection approval. Your address is saved to your Vasudha profile automatically.

### No-Wallet Path for Donors

Wallet connection is entirely optional. Without MetaMask:
- VGC earned is tracked in Vasudha's database with full balance history
- Sell via **Vasudha Managed Buyback** — Vasudha purchases your VGC at floor price and transfers INR to your UPI ID within 24 hours
- Connect a wallet at any time — accumulated balance transfers automatically

---

## Buying VGC — Enterprise Flow

<img src="./assets/screenshots/marketplace.png" alt="Buy VGC flow" width="100%" />

### Self-Serve (Marketplace)

1. Go to `/marketplace/buy`
2. Filter listings by quantity, price per VGC, or seller type
3. Each listing shows:
   - Available VGC quantity
   - Price per VGC (INR)
   - Seller (restaurant name or Vasudha Treasury)
   - Verification badge → links to Polygonscan rescue record
4. Click **"Buy with MetaMask"**
5. Confirm MATIC transaction → VGC transfers to your wallet
6. Click **"Download ESG Certificate"**

### Retiring Credits (ESG Compliance)

To prevent double-counting, enterprises should retire VGC after purchasing.

1. Go to `/marketplace` → **"Retire My Credits"**
2. Select amount to retire
3. MetaMask calls `burn()` on the VGC contract
4. Credits permanently destroyed on-chain
5. **Retirement Certificate** issued with burn transaction hash — suitable for BRSR and annual sustainability reports

### B2B Packages (> 100 VGC)

For bulk purchases:
- INR invoice with GST
- Volume pricing
- Custom MRV report per industry vertical
- Annual subscription for continuous offsetting

---

## Selling VGC — Donor Flow

<img src="./assets/flows/sell-vgc-flow.png" alt="Sell VGC flow" width="100%" />

### Path A — Marketplace (MetaMask)

1. Go to `/marketplace/sell`
2. View available VGC balance
3. Enter quantity to list and price per VGC (minimum: floor price)
4. Click **"List for Sale"** — VGC is escrowed in the smart contract
5. When a buyer purchases, MATIC arrives in your MetaMask wallet automatically

### Path B — Vasudha Managed Buyback (No Crypto)

1. Donor dashboard → **"Withdraw to UPI"**
2. Enter your UPI ID
3. Vasudha purchases your VGC at floor price
4. INR transferred within 24 hours

### Path C — Cancel a Listing

Cancel any active listing from `/marketplace/my-listings`. Escrowed VGC returns to your balance immediately.

---

## NGO Volunteer Delivery Flow

The volunteer interface is built for a single-handed mobile experience on a low-end Android browser. No app download required.

<img src="./assets/screenshots/ngo-dispatch.png" alt="NGO dispatch interface on mobile" width="100%" />

**Step 1 — Open `/ngo` on your phone**

Enter your NGO ID. Active assignments appear automatically.

**Step 2 — Review assignment**

```
  Rescue Assignment
  ├── Food description and quantity
  ├── Donor name and tap-to-call phone number
  ├── Pickup address
  ├── Expiry countdown timer
  └── Estimated travel time (OSRM)
```

**Step 3 — Tap "I'm On My Way"**

Map draws your route from your current location to the pickup address using OSRM free routing (OpenStreetMap-based, no API key). Turn-by-turn instructions appear below the map. The donor's tracking screen updates live.

**Step 4 — Tap "I've Collected The Food"**

After collecting from the restaurant. The map redraws the route from pickup to the nearest active hunger zone.

**Step 5 — Tap "I've Delivered It"**

This single tap triggers the full delivery confirmation:

```
  ✅ Listing status → 'rescued'
  ✅ VGC minted on Polygon (Flask backend)
  ✅ 50% VGC credited to donor wallet
  ✅ 50% VGC added to Vasudha treasury
  ✅ Impact certificate generated
  ✅ Global impact counters incremented
  ✅ Donor tracking card updates to completion
```

```

**Key architectural decisions:**
- The frontend **never** calls Supabase directly — all data flows through Flask
- VGC **minting** happens exclusively in the Flask backend (private key never exposed)
- VGC **buying and retiring** happen from the user's own MetaMask wallet (user controls their key)
- OSRM and Nominatim are called from the **backend** — not exposed to clients

## Local Setup

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- Python 3.11+
- Supabase account (free tier sufficient)
- Anthropic API key
- MetaMask browser extension (for wallet features)

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-org/vasudha.git
cd vasudha
```

### 2. Initialise the database

1. Create a new project at [supabase.com](https://supabase.com)
2. Open SQL Editor → New Query
3. Paste the full contents of `backend/schema.sql` and run
4. Copy your **Project URL** and **Service Role Key** from Settings → API

### 3. Start the backend

```bash
cd backend
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate          # Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
cp .env.example .env
# Fill in SUPABASE_URL, SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY, ANTHROPIC_API_KEY, ADMIN_SECRET
python app.py
```

Verify: `curl http://localhost:5000/health` → `{"status": "ok"}`

### 4. Seed demo data

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/admin/seed-demo \
  -H "X-Admin-Secret: your-admin-password"
```

Creates restaurants, NGOs, and hunger zone coordinates for Jaipur.

### 5. Start the frontend

```bash
cd ../frontend
npm install
cp .env.local.example .env.local
# Fill in NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL and contract addresses
npm run dev
```

Frontend at `http://localhost:3000`.

### 6. Deploy smart contracts (optional for local dev)

```bash
cd ../contracts
npm install
# Add your deployer private key and RPC to hardhat.config.js
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network amoy
# Copy output addresses into frontend/.env.local
```

---

## Deployment

### Frontend → Vercel

```bash
cd frontend
npx vercel --prod
# Set all NEXT_PUBLIC_* variables in the Vercel dashboard
```

### Backend → Railway

1. Push the repo to GitHub
2. New project on [railway.app](https://railway.app) → Deploy from GitHub
3. Set root directory to `backend/`
4. Add all environment variables in Railway's settings
5. Add `Procfile` in `backend/`:
```
web: gunicorn app:app --workers 2 --bind 0.0.0.0:$PORT --timeout 120
```
6. Update `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` in Vercel to your Railway URL

### Smart Contracts → Polygon Mainnet

```bash
# Update hardhat.config.js with mainnet RPC
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network polygon
# Update contract addresses in Vercel environment variables
```

---

## Carbon Credit Methodology

### CO₂ Calculation Basis

The 2.5 kg CO₂e per kg food waste figure is derived from:
- IPCC Sixth Assessment Report (AR6) — food system emissions
- Verra VM0046 Methodology — avoided landfill methane emissions
- FAO 2019 — *The State of Food and Agriculture*

### MRV Data Collected Per Rescue

| Field | Source | Stored at |
|---|---|---|
| Food quantity (kg) | Donor-reported | Listing creation |
| Pickup GPS coordinates | Donor address → Nominatim | Listing creation |
| Pickup timestamp | Server UTC | Listing creation |
| Collection timestamp | NGO tap → server UTC | `collected` status update |
| Delivery timestamp | NGO tap → server UTC | `delivered` status update |
| Blockchain anchor | Polygon transaction hash | On VGC mint |

### Certification Pathway

| Phase | Timeline | Milestone |
|---|---|---|
| Pre-Verified Impact Tokens | Launch | VGC issued with full MRV data, accepted for voluntary ESG reporting |
| CCTS Application | 6 months | Apply under India's Carbon Credit Trading Scheme Voluntary Offset Mechanism (BEE, 2025) |
| Pilot Certification | 12 months | First batch receives official CCTS Carbon Credit Certificates |
| Verra Methodology | 18 months | Joint application with food rescue network for Verra recognition |

---
